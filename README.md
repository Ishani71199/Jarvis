# J.A.R.V.I.S - Just A Rather Very Intelligent System
## Created and Tested on Windows with Python 3.8.1
As we know Python is a suitable language for script writers and developers. Let’s write a script for Voice Assistant using Python. The query for the assistant can be manipulated as per the user’s need. 
Speech recognition is the process of converting audio into text. This is commonly used in voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc. This project does not implement any sort of machine learning or language processing. Python provides an API called SpeechRecognition to allow us to convert audio into text for further processing. 

## Requirements:
Make sure you install these packages before moving forward to other python libraries-
- ### Speech Recognition
        pip install SpeechRecognition

- ### PyAudio 
        pip install PyAudio

- ### ttsx: (Offline Text to Speech Service)
        pip install pyttsx3

- ### winshell
        pip install winshell

- ### subprocess
        pip install subprocess

- ### requests
        pip install requests
